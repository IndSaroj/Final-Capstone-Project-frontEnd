       <h3>Car Loan FAQs</h3>
       </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q1. What is a car loan?</b></p>
        <p>A car loan is a borrowing instrument that a lender such as a bank or NBFC (non-banking financial company) provides an individual allowing him/her to purchase a car. Car loans have gained popularity in recent times as instead of being a luxury item or a symbol of status, cars have grown to become an essential commodity for the continuously growing middle class of India. With the increased popularity of car loans, most banks and NBFCs currently offer this type of loan to individuals who have a good credit history. One point to keep in mind regarding a car loan is the fact that this loan invests in a depreciating asset i.e. the asset (car) bought using this loan is in fact going to cost less over time.</p>

      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q2. Can I get a loan to purchase a used car?</b> </p>
        <p>Yes, car loan is offered for pre-used cars. But, the interest rate for such a loan would differ from that of a new car. However, the loan would only cover the price of the car itself, other costs as transfer of registration, etc. will have to borne by you.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p> <b>Q3. Do I need collateral for a car loan?</b></p>
        <p>Just as the name suggests, a car loan is a loan granted to an individual interested in buying a car. Therefore a car loan is a secured loan where the car you buy acts as a collateral. Therefore, there is no additional collateral requirement for a car loan. However, you do have to get the RC (registration certificate) of the car endorsed with the bank. This endorsement is cancelled after repayment of the loan is completed.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q4. What is the maximum amount of loan that I can avail?</b></p>
        <p>The maximum loan amount approved may vary from one bank to the other. For us we approve loan amounts that range from 80%–90% of the car’s on-road price. Few banks even lend 100% of the car’s ex-showroom price. In addition to these criteria, the percentage of financing offered depends on the price, type of car (standard/ premium) and whether you are applying for a new or pre-owned car.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q5. What documents do I need to submit when applying for a car loan?</b></p>
        <p>Like any other loan that you apply for, a car loan application requires self attested supporting documents such as income (last three pay slips/last three months statement), address and identity proof documents along with your PAN card. Other documentation requirements, if any, tend to differ from one loan policy to another.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q6. What is the typical tenure of a car loan?</b></p>
        <p>The tenure of a car loan ranges from 1 year to 7 years. The shorter the loan tenure, the higher is the EMI payable and the reverse is true for longer car loan tenures. Currently, a small number of lenders are engaged in providing car loans for longer durations of up to 7 years.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q7. Is there a minimum salary requirement to apply for a car loan?</b></p>
        <p>Though most lenders do not specify a minimum salary requirement, your loan application may be rejected in case your salary does not exceed a predetermined threshold level as required by the internal requirement of the bank. For us if your are salaried person then you must provide income proof earning more than 2.5 LPA and in case you are self employed then you must be earning more than 2 LPA.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q8. Do I need a loan guarantor or co-borrower?</b></p>
        <p>A loan guarantor or a co-borrower is only required if you are unable to meet the eligibility criteria stated by the lending institution such as monthly income, age or credit score. Otherwise you can apply for a car loan on your own.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q9. In which cases can my car loan application be rejected?</b></p>
        <p>Your loan application may be rejected if you have a bad credit score, have defaulted on your repayments or applied for and been rejected for loans multiple times, etc. Also, you should meet the bank’s eligibility criteria such as minimum income level, age, previous relationship with the bank, etc. to get your loan approved.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q10. Are there any tax benefits of a car loan?</b></p>
        <p>No. Unlike a home loan, a car loan has no tax savings benefits what so ever. Therefore car loan amounts should always be tied to your actual requirement and splurging on a fancy car by taking a large loan amount is not a good idea.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q11. Can interest rates be negotiated?</b></p>
        <p>Yes, you can negotiate the interest rate applicable to your car loan by leveraging your credit history and prior relationship with the prospective lender. The regular payment of EMIs for previous loan/credit cards you had/have with your prospective lender can fetch you a car loan at a preferred (lower) interest rate.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q12. Can I get financing for insurance and registration?</b></p>
        <p>Car loans do not cover the insurance or registration fees that you have to pay at the time of buying the vehicle. Car insurance, which is mandatory, needs to be purchased separately and all vehicle registration-related costs also have to be borne by you as they are not covered by your car loan. However, there are few banks that cover these costs under special schemes.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q13. Can I sell my car before repayment of the car loan is completed?</b></p>
        <p>No. Lenders who provide car loans to individuals only allow the car to be sold to a new owner when the loan has been paid off in full. This is because, you need to a get a NOC from the bank before you can sell you car and the document is released only after you have paid off the car loan in full.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q14. What if I don’t pay EMIs on time?</b></p>
        <p>Generally, banks treat you as a defaulter if you fail to pay two or more EMIs in a timely manner. You will initially be charged a penalty fee and asked to regularise your payments. If you fail to regularise your payments after repeated notifications, the financial institution can legally repossess your vehicle. Subsequently, your credit score will also take a hit and in the future, you will face complications in future loan approvals.</p>

      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q15. What is zero percent Financing?</b></p>
        <p>Zero percent financing is an offer provided by a few automobile manufacturers in collaboration with the lender. Under this plan, the automobile manufacturer is responsible for paying back the interest on the car loan to the financier instead of the borrower.</p>
      </div>
      <div className='m-2'>
        <p><b>Q16. Why are zero percent financing car models more expensive than the other ones?</b></p>
        <p>As the manufacturer is liable to pay the interest component of the car loan, the manufacturer would have to maintain a higher profit margin on the sale. That is the reason why, the cost of zero financing car models is usually greater than the cost of car models that do not have this feature.</p>
